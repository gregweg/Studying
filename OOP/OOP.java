	//	Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employes:
	// 	fresher
	// 	Technical Lead (TM)
	// 	Product Manager (PM)
	//	There can be multiple employees, but only one TL or PM. An incoming telephone call must be allocated
	// 	to a fresher who is free. If a fresher can't handle the call, he or she must escalate the call
	//	to technical lead. If the TL is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated
	// 	to PM. Design the classes and data structures for this problem. Implement a method getCallHandler().

	//	Explain how you would design a chat server. In particular, provide details abou the various
	//	backend components, classes, and methods. What would be the hardest problems to solve?
	
	
	
	//	Othello is played as follows: Each Othello piece is white on one side and black on the other.
	//	When a piece is surrounded by its opponents on both the left and right sides, or both the top
	//	and bottom, it is said to be captured and it's color is flipped. On your turn, you must capture
	//	at least one of your opponent's pieces. The game ends when either user has no more valid moves,
	//	and the win ias assigned to the person with the most pieces. Implement the object oriented design for Othello.
	
	
	
	//	Explain the data structures and algorithms that you would use to design an in-memory file system.
	//	Illustrate with an example in code where possible.
